              Rift Watcher is a League of Legends (LoL) statistics-tracking 
              application designed to help players unlock their full potential on the Rift. 
              By entering your summoner name, Rift Watcher can provide a variety of relevant gameplay
              analytics such as gold income over time, KDA trends, champion performance insights, and
              much more. We aim to provide the most accurate and relevant data possible so you can focus 
              less on making sense of the data, and more on climbing the ranked ladder.
              <br/><br/>
              Rift Watcher also offers the Hextech Build Calculator, which provides players with an intuitive tool
              that makes it easy to theory-craft builds while taking champion statistics into account. The Hextech 
              Build Calculator allows users to add any item in League of Legends to their build, and see how these items 
              would interact with a champion&apos;s base statistics. The Hextech Build Calculator also offers insights into
              the cost of each build, saving players from the perils of mental math.

            <h1 className={styles.info_section_header}>How We Collect Our Data</h1>

            <p className={styles.info_section_text}>
              All of our data comes directly from the Official Riot games API. Using the information
              provided by Riot, we use a variety of formulas to extrapolate useful information such as 
              immediate and seasonal winrate, or average visionscore per game. Moreover, we construct personalized 
              user profiles that showcase a player&apos;s strengths and weaknesses. We only use your data to visualize League 
              of Legends statistics, and your data will never leave our domain. Furthermore, we do not share nor publicize 
              your data in any form without consent.

            <p className={styles.info_section_text}>
              Rift Watcher is a powerful tool intended to help you climb the League of Legends ranked ladder. 
              Rift Watcher identifies your strengths and weaknesses as a player using your current and historical 
              game data. We also provide personalized analytics to help you identify patterns in your gameplay
              over the span of a single match, 20 games, or even an entire season. By providing analytics on
              each player&apos;s trends over long periods of time, we&apos;re able to provide some clarity on what areas a player
              both struggles and exceeds in. By providing clarity, we hope that each player can break any barrier that may be holding them
              back from their new peak rank.
              <br/><br/>
              Rift Watcher is in active developmentâ€”we hope to publish a roadmap and list of current and upcoming 
              features in a coming update.

              The development of Rift Watcher would not be possible without the hard work of
              many different groups of people. Special thanks to the folks over at Community Dragon
              for creating such a useful and convenient CDN, while also fostering a friendly, knowledgable
              community over on their Discord server. Below you will find a list of contributors who helped shape Rift
              Watcher in a variety of ways, and to whom I&apos;m grateful for (with the exception of myself lol).
